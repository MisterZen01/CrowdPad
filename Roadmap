Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for YouTube Crowd Control integration. These enhancements aim to expand functionality and improve user experience.

Future Changes (TBA):
-Have pyautogui or a similar python library be compatible using the touch screen of the DS on retroarch.
Note: The 3DS is not available on Retroarch so it will have to remain on a standalone emulator until then.
